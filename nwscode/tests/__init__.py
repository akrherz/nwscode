A collection of tests.  Run ``py.test``.

All of these tests are written for ``py.test``.  You'll need ``py.test``
to run them.  You can find ``py.test`` here:

    http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html

If you are not familiary with ``py.test``, I suggest you look into it.
It's really quite nice.
